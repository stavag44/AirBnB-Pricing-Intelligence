# AirBnB Pricing Intelligence

Carried forward from the Cornell MSBA capstone (BANA 5160), which is the origin of the model, the data work and every figure below. That repository stays as the academic record and is not edited further; this one is where the work continues.

## Capstone README, reproduced for reference

This project builds a **hybrid analytics engine for NYC Airbnb hosts** that combines a hedonic pricing regression with KNN competitive-cohort benchmarking — pinpointing exact nightly revenue losses and prescribing the specific operational and amenity upgrades needed to close them.

The dataset was obtained from **Inside Airbnb**, an independent, non-commercial open-source project that aggregates publicly available data from the Airbnb platform. The snapshot is New York City, captured **June 14, 2026** — 30,259 raw listings filtered to **9,752 active listings**.

---

## The business use case

**Problem.** Hosts have no objective way to know whether they are over- or under-priced, or what to change about the listing itself. Verified occupancy by host tier (mean `occupancy_rate_calendar`) runs **Individual 44.1%, Small-Multi 37.8%, Mid-Multi 32.6%, Enterprise 30.0%** — occupancy *declines* as host scale increases. Individual hosts already hold the strongest demand in the market, which makes pricing that demand correctly the actual problem to solve, rather than an occupancy deficit that isn't there.

> **Erratum (2026-07-28).** An earlier version of this README claimed a reversed occupancy gap (Small-Multi 71.5% vs Individual 47.3%). The 71.5% figure does not reproduce from `active_listings_clean_v6.csv` under any occupancy metric checked (mean, median, calendar-based, or raw days-booked), and no source notebook survives to check it against — most likely a transcription error from the original EDA writeup. The Individual (47.3%) and Enterprise (37.2%, see `Data Cleaning Process.md`) figures do reproduce closely, so the error looks isolated to the one number. The corrected figures and direction are what appear above and in all current slide/script content.

**Our solution — a Revenue Optimizer (Option C).** A two-layer, host-facing diagnostic:

1. **Fair-value pricing engine** — a hedonic regression estimates what each listing *should* charge given its location, size, amenities, and ratings. The gap between actual and fair price is the **mispricing signal** ("you're priced $X above/below comparable value").
2. **Comparable-cohort benchmarking (the "why")** — KNN matches each listing to genuinely similar peers, isolates the high-occupancy performers among them, and surfaces the concrete amenity/operational gaps to close.

**The deliverable a host receives:**
> *"Your listing is underpriced by $X/night relative to its fair value. To capture that missing yield without hurting occupancy, close your feature gap: your high-performing peers offer a dedicated workspace and self-check-in — you don't."*

Positioned commercially as either a **direct-to-consumer SaaS** tool for independent hosts or a **B2B value-add dashboard** a platform could offer to improve inventory quality and marketplace volume.

## Model version progression

| Version | Approach | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Model v1** (`model v1/`) | Log-linear OLS baseline | Superseded |
| **Model v2** (`model v2/`) | Ridge regression + KNN benchmarking, segment-split (6-model bake-off selected Ridge for coefficient stability) | Superseded |
| **Model v3** (`model v3/`) | Same Ridge engine as v2, adds confidence scoring + host-tier-aware KNN | Superseded — its KNN layer and segment diagnostics carried forward into v4 |
| **Model v4** (`model v4/`) | **GBM quantile regression (q10/q50/q90) with conformal calibration**, same host-tier-aware KNN layer carried forward, plus seasonality, two live UI tools, a real-price scraper proof of concept, and a price-elasticity pilot | **✅ CURRENT — this is what the deliverable runs on** |

Each version's own README explains why the change was made, not just what changed. Full narrative in [`NYC_Airbnb_Appendix_Technical.docx`](https://github.com/mkdn007/Cornell-Airbnb-Capstone/blob/main/NYC_Airbnb_Appendix_Technical.docx); anticipated Q&A challenges with prepared answers in [`NYC_Airbnb_Anticipated_Questions.docx`](https://github.com/mkdn007/Cornell-Airbnb-Capstone/blob/main/NYC_Airbnb_Anticipated_Questions.docx).

## Repository status — what's production, what isn't

**`main` is the production branch.** It holds everything the final presentation runs on. Nothing else needs to be checked out to review, run, or grade this project.

### Branches

| Branch | Status |
|---|---|
| **`main`** | ✅ **PRODUCTION.** The current, complete state of the project. |
| `final-model-package` | **Merged, retained for history.** Fully contained in `main` (merged 2026-07-28 as `model v4/`). Nothing unique remains on it. |
| `pending-planning-doc-qa-resolved` | **Merged, retained for history.** Fully contained in `main`. |
| `jai` | **Stale, superseded.** Last commit 2026-07-17; fully contained in `main`, which is 25 commits ahead. Nothing unique remains on it. Diffing it against `main` shows large apparent deletions — that is simply how far the project has moved since July 17, not work that would be lost. |
| `v3-confidence-fix-and-seasonality` | **Merged 2026-07-31, retained for history.** Carried the `model v3/` directory; now fully contained in `main`. |

**Every branch is now fully contained in `main`.** Nothing unique remains on any of them, so `main` alone is the complete project.

### Production artifacts inside `model v4/`

| Path | Status |
|---|---|
| `model v4/model/` | ✅ Production — GBM quantile-regression engine + KNN layer |
| `model v4/elasticity/` | ✅ Production — price-elasticity pilot (TWFE) and the business-case documents built on it |
| `model v4/ui/` | ✅ Production — the two interactive prototypes shown in the recorded demo |
| `model v4/ui/_archive/` | ⛔ Deprecated — superseded UI versions, kept for history only |
| `model v4/scraper/` | Proof of concept — real-price scraper, not part of the production pipeline |

### Superseded, kept as development history

| Path | Status |
|---|---|
| `model v1/`, `model v2/`, `model v3/` | ⛔ Superseded by `model v4/`. Retained so the version progression is reviewable; each carries its own README explaining what it contributed and where that work went. |
| `model v3/proposed-confidence-fix/` | ⛔ A *proposal* that was never adopted — v4's conformal calibration made the approach obsolete. Kept as a record of the reasoning, not as shipped code. |
| `model v4/ui/_archive/` | ⛔ Superseded UI versions |
| `_project-history/` | ⛔ Early-stage planning documents, kept for provenance. **Contains figures later retracted** — notably the 71.5%/47.3% host-tier occupancy claim corrected in the erratum above. Read as a record of how the project started, not as current findings. |
| `Presentation Planning Notes (DEPRECATED ...).docx` | ⛔ Superseded 2026-07-26 |
